# docker_hello_world
An example of a hello world docker app

## A simple `Hello World docker image` 

First create a DockerFile in the root directory of the project.


```
# Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]`
```
To use this image, first make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Then, create a file called `app.py` in the same directory as the `Dockerfile` and add the following code to it:


```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
 return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '\_\_main\_\_':
 app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)`
```
Next, create a file called `requirements.txt` and add the following line to it:


```
Copy code`flask`
```
Now, to build the Docker image, run the following command:


```
Copy code`docker build -t hello-world .`
```
This will create a Docker image with the name `hello-world`. To run the image, use the following command:


```
Copy code`docker run -p 80:80 hello-world`
```
This will start a container running the `hello-world` image and map port 80 on the host machine to port 80 in the container. You should then be able to access the "Hello World" application by going to `http://localhost` in your web browser.

## How can I publish this to Docker Hub?

To publish your Docker image to Docker Hub, you will first need to create an account on Docker Hub. Once you have an account, you can log in to Docker Hub from the command line using the `docker login` command.

After logging in, you can use the `docker tag` command to give your image a name and tag, which is a version number that identifies the specific version of your image. For example, you might tag your image as `hello-world:1.0`.

Once you have tagged your image, you can use the `docker push` command to push the image to Docker Hub. For example, if your Docker Hub username is `myusername` and you have tagged your image as `hello-world:1.0`, you would run the following command to push the image:


```
Copy code`docker push myusername/hello-world:1.0`
```
This will push your `hello-world:1.0` image to Docker Hub, where it will be available for other users to download and use. You can then use the `docker pull` command to download the image on another machine, and use the `docker run` command to run the image in a container.

For example, to download and run the `hello-world:1.0` image on another machine, you would run the following commands:


```
Copy code`# Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull myusername/hello-world:1.0

# Run the image in a container
docker run -p 80:80 myusername/hello-world:1.0`
```
These commands will download the `hello-world:1.0` image from Docker Hub, and then run it in a container. You should then be able to access the "Hello World" application by going to `http://localhost` in your web browser.

This command allows you to remove one or more Docker images from your local machine.

For example, to delete the `hello-world:1.0` image from your local machine, you would run the following command:


```
Copy code`docker rmi hello-world:1.0`
```
This will remove the `hello-world:1.0` image from your local machine, but it will still be available on Docker Hub. To delete the image from Docker Hub as well, you will need to use the `docker push` command with the `--delete` flag.

For example, if your Docker Hub username is `myusername` and you want to delete the `hello-world:1.0` image from Docker Hub, you would run the following command:


```
Copy code`docker push --delete myusername/hello-world:1.0`
```
This will delete the `hello-world:1.0` image from Docker Hub, and it will no longer be available for other users to download and use.

Note that you can only delete images that you have pushed to Docker Hub yourself. If you have not pushed the image to Docker Hub, or if the image was pushed by another user, you will not be able to delete it.
